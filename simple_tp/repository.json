Adjust according to your configuration file.\n- !!stp help View help information\n\nPreview commands can be found in the [language file](https://github.com/PairZhu/SimpleTP-MCDR/tree/master/./lang/en_us.yml) under the help section.\n\n## Configuration File\nThe configuration file is located at `config/SimpleTP/config.json`\n- **prefix**: Command prefix, default is `!!stp`\n- **back_on_death**: Whether to automatically record the position upon player death, default is `true`\n- **save_interval**: Interval for scheduled saving of waypoint data, in seconds, default is `30` seconds\n- **permissions**: Permission configuration\n- **worlds**: List of supported dimensions (including mod dimensions), default is `[\"minecraft:overworld\", \"minecraft:the_nether\", \"minecraft:the_end\"]`. Teleportation will not work in dimensions not in this list. To disable teleportation in a dimension, simply remove it from the list.\n- **extra_dimensions**: ***Only required for Minecraft versions before 1.16***, configuration format is `{<dimension_id>: \"<dimension_name>\"}`, for example `{0: \"minecraft:overworld\", 1: \"minecraft:the_nether\", 2: \"minecraft:the_end\"}`. This configuration is used to support mod dimensions in older Minecraft versions.\n- **easy_tp**: Whether to enable easytp syntax sugar, default is `true`.\n\n### Permission Configuration\n- **back**: Permission to use `!!stp back` command\n- **tpa**: Permission to use `!!stp tpa` command\n- **tpahere**: Permission to use `!!stp tpahere` command\n- **tp**: Permission to use `!!stp tp <player>` command\n- **tphere**: Permission to use `!!stp tphere <player>` command\n- **personal_waypoint**: Permission to set/delete personal waypoint related commands\n- **global_waypoint**: Permission to set/delete global waypoint related commands\n- **cross_world_tp**: Permission for cross-dimension teleportation\n\n## Dependencies\n- **minecraft_data_api**: Used for retrieving player information\n- **mg_events**: Used for listening to player death events\n\n## Common Issues\n- **Clickable Teleport Button Not Responding**\n  MCDR has issues with click execution support in higher MC versions. Install [LetMeClickAndSendForServer](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/LetMeClickAndSendForServer) (server-side) or [LetMeClickAndSend](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/LetMeClickAndSend) (client-side).\n- **Sometimes `back` Command Doesn't Return to Previous Location After Death**\n  Some mod death messages are special and may not be detected by mg_events. You need to manually add corresponding death messages in mg_events language files. For example, for the [Eternal Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/eternal-starlight) mod, when players die in the Ether, add `\"death.attack.ether\": \"%1$s drifts away\"` to `config/mg_events/lang/en_us.json`, and `\"death.attack.ether\": \"%1$s飘然而去\"` to `config/mg_events/lang/zh_cn.json`.\n- **Log Shows \"Player {player} is in a dimension not enabled in config: {dimension}\"**\n  This indicates the player is in a dimension not enabled in the configuration. Check the `worlds` configuration in `config/SimpleTP/config.json` to ensure the dimension is included.\n- **Log Shows \"Player {player} is in an unknown dimension with ID {dimension}\"**\n  This error may occur when the server Minecraft version is before 1.16 and mod dimensions are installed. Check the `extra_dimensions` configuration in `config/SimpleTP/config.json` to ensure the dimension is included. You can get the dimension ID using the `/data get entity <player> Dimension` command.\n\n## TODO\nIf you have more feature requests or are interested in any planned features, feel free to raise them in the issues section 🚀\nSorted by priority:\n- [x] Support clickable waypoints\n- [x] `back` command supports round-trip teleportation\n- [x] Record player's dimension in waypoints (Nether, Overworld, End)\n- [x] Configuration for cross-dimension teleportation\n- [x] Scheduled saving of waypoint data (to prevent loss on crash)\n- [x] `tp`/`tphere` functionality\n- [x] `tpa`/`tpahere` functionality\n- [x] Multi-language support\n- [x] Help information\n- [ ] Record player's orientation in waypoints\n- [ ] Add description information for waypoints\n- [ ] Teleport cooldown configuration\n- [ ] Maximum number of waypoints configuration\n- [ ] Waypoint name length limit configuration\n- [ ] Waypoint safety check, prompting confirmation or teleporting to nearby safe location if the waypoint is in a dangerous position\n- [ ] Teleport cost configuration (consume custom items or experience) (base cost + distance cost)\n",
