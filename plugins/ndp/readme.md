### Introduction

​No Danger Player (NDP)​​ is an open-source cross-server ban synchronization plugin designed to maintain real-time ban list synchronization across multiple servers, preventing malicious players from accessing any connected server. Centralized ban management significantly enhances server network security and administrative efficiency.

#TIPS: If your server or home city is a plugin side, it is strongly recommended that you install [NDP-plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/ndp-plugins)(NO MCDR Plugin).
