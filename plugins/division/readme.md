## Escape Character

Cause players cannot type the symbol `§` in MC which made them cannot use the color code

This plugin offers `$` as an escape character

When a player uses `$` when leaving a message, the plugin automatically converts it to the symbol `§`

When the player needs to enter the symbol `$`, enter `$$`

## URL Convert

The plugin will recognize anything that starts with `http` and ends with a space as a URL
