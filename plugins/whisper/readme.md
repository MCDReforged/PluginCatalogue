## Description
Send some private message to others at same time in easier way.<br>
Use triggers (default<strong>'**'</strong>) to send private messages to everyone the player specifies.
## How to use
1. Use `!!whisper <player>` command add player(s) can receive private message
2. Prepare a writable_book and rename it to "MCDRwhisper" and place it in the hotbar
3. Write your whispered words in writable_book~, be careful not to break lines
4. Then enter the default trigger ** in the chat bar
5. They should be able to hear from you~
6. Before whispering the next time, remember to empty the contents of the writable_book ~~（I originally wanted to clear it automatically, but I won't use /data command）~~
7. Just that, you can avoid using commands such as /tell to send messages to different people one by one
## Attention
- The message to be sent needs to be written in a writable_book called <strong>"MCDRwhisper"</strong> in the hotbar
- Make sure there is no <strong>LINE BREAKS</strong> in the message to be sent
- Before whispering the next time, remember to <strong>EMPTY</strong> the contents of the writable_book
