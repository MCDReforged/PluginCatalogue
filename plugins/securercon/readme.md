# SecureRCON

An MCDR plugin that encrypts your RCON access and extends RCON functionality.

## Why?

The vanilla RCON protocol transmits data in plain text (including the password and commands), so encrypting RCON is useful. With extended RCON functionality, you can execute MCDR commands and send chat messages.

## Encryption Method and Access Instructions

After installing this plugin, if any ports on your machine are exposed to the internet, please use a firewall (e.g., ufw / firewalled / iptables) to block access. Also, set a strong RCON password. This plugin will automatically read the RCON password and listen on a port (default is 25576). The protocol on this port is compatible with the original RCON, so if you're using a vanilla RCON client, you can still connect using a fixed strong password or a dynamic one.

### SecureMCRCON Python Package
