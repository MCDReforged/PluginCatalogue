Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Elec-Glacier/liteloader_handler/releases)\n2. Place this plugin in your MCDR \"plugins\" directory\n3. Start MCDR\n4. Change and choose the handler in mcdreforged \"config\" directory\n5. reload the config\n\n## Notice\nAfter LeviLamina@1.0.0, Popen() can't get stdout after server being modded. You can use a pty terminal as bridge. You can see more details in [this issue](https://github.com/Elec-Glacier/liteloader_handler/issues/13)\nAfter version 1.2.0, this handler has adapted to PrimeBackup. You can turn it off in config.\n\n## MCDR plugins installation notice\nSince Bedrock and Java edition are different in many aspects, so read the introductions of other MCDR plugins you want to use and make sure them would work correctly before you place them into plugins directory.\n\n## Attentions\nDue to a [BDS bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-3791), you might need to use some server modified plugins to let MCDR work correctly, such as [UnicodeFixer](https://www.minebbs.com/resources/unicodefixer.6991/).\n",
