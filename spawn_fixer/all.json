This works for both new and old players.\n\nStill in developing...\n\n### v0.0.1\n\nThe principle of this plugin is to use the `/spawnpoint` command to set the spawn point for each player, when they firstly joined the server.\n\n**Player first join detection**\n\nPlugin will read filenames of files in `</path/to/server>/<world_name>/playerdata`, and get existing players' UUID list from them.\n\nAfter server startup, if a player is joining, and there is no UUID matched with his/her name before, plugin will execute the `/spawnpoint <UUID> <x> <y> <z>` to set the spawn point for him/her. And plugin will also refresh the UUID list when command execution is finished.\n\n## Installation\nExecute `!!MCDR plg install spawn_fixer [--confirm]` in MCDR console.\n> Will available once this plugin is submitted successfully to MCDR PluginCatalogue.\n\nOr download the `SpawnFixer-v*.mcdr` file from [Releases](https://github.com/MCDReforged/SpawnFixer-MCDR/releases) and put it into `</path/to/mcdr>/plugins` directory.\n\n### Dependency\n**PyPI packages need**:\n> Following plugins are not used at present, will be required in the future versions.\n- `requirements.txt`\n```txt\nmcdreforged\njavaproperties\n```\n\n**MCDR plugins need**:\n> Following plugins are not used at present, will be required in the future versions.\n- MoreCommandNodes | [GitHub](https://github.com/AnzhiZhang/MCDReforgedPlugins/tree/master/src/more_command_nodes) | [PluginCatalogue](https://mcdreforged.com/en/plugin/more_command_nodes)\n> Optional, for pos arguments check like `<x> <y> <z>`.\n\n- AysncRconClient | [GitHub](https://github.com/Mooling0602/AsyncRconClient) | [PluginCatalogue](https://mcdreforged.com/en/plugin/async_rcon)\n> Optional, another rcon support.\n\n- Minecraft Data API | [GitHub](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MinecraftDataAPI) | [PluginCatalogue](https://mcdreforged.com/en/plugin/minecraft_data_api)\n> Optional, get player's data by `/data` easily, and no rcon need.\n\n## Usage\nConfiguration file is in `<path/to/mcdr>/config/spawn_fixer/config.yml`.\n```yaml\nserver_path:\n  - path: server\n  - use_mcdr_config: true\n  - world_name: world\nspawnpoint:\n  - x: 0\n  - y: 64\n  - z: 0\nforce_dimension: false\ntarget_dimension: minecraft\\:overworld\n```\n\n### Debug\n> Will implemented in later versions.\n> After configured, make sure you have installed necessary dependencies, and I recommend you to install other optional dependencies also.\n\nThen, start MCDR server, and after server startup, execute `!!spawn_fixer debug` in MCDR console.\n\nIf anything goes well, you will see every check is passed, otherwise, try to fix by following the tips.\n\n## NOTE\nGamerule `spawnRadius` is not longer supported if you use this plugin.\n\n## Credits\n- Licensed under GPLv3.\n",
