It allows you to set up your server as a plugin control group, primarily used for communication between plugins across different sub-servers, such as providing APIs and communication support for cross-server chat. It offers high security and easy configuration, making it suitable for various server environments.\n\nEnglish | [简中](https://github.com/zhongbai2333/ConnectCore/tree/master/README_zh.md)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Standalone Usage\n\n1.
