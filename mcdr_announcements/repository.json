(Known issues: Since the installation process is a non-blocking operation, the first time the plugin may run without the library)\n+ Fixed the problem of redundant warnings or error messages appearing on the console when starting the server in version `v1.2.1`\n\n### v1.2.1 Update\n+ Plugins can now remember the enabled state when they were last exited, and restore it the next time they are launched.\n+ The first announcement display after the plugin is loaded has been cancelled.\n+ Optimized the timer and some details.\n+ Optimized some prompt texts and added some hovering text prompts.\n+ Added status display and other commands.\n\n  `!!an help`: Same as `!!an`\n\n  `!!an reload`: Reload the plugin\n\n  `!!an status`: Show the current status\n\n### v1.2.0 update\n+ Added support for Chinese, the plug-in will automatically select the display language based on the server language preference.\n+ The plug-in format is changed to `*.mcdr` packaging format, replacing the previous `*.py` single file format.\n\n### v1.1.0 update\n\n+ Now commands are allowed to configure instead of editing the yaml file.\n\n  `!!an`:  Show this help message list\n\n  `!!an enable`:  Enable the timed announcement\n\n  `!!an disable`:  Disable the timed announcement\n\n  `!!an set <message>`:  Set the content of announcement\n\n  <strong>Notice:</strong> `\\n` for next line and `&` for the color text. If you use Chinese in this command, please add `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` in your start command. Such as `java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar server.jar nogui`\n\n  `!!an time <seconds>`:  Set the interval time (seconds/time)\n\n+ The status is set to False by default now. Please enable it manually.\n+ Only admin and owner can run commands.\n",
